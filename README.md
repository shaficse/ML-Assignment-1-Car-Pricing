# ML-Assignment-1-Car-Pricing

This project aims to predict the selling prices of used cars based on various features using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used for this project includes information about different cars such as  year, engine specifications, fuel type, transmission, and more.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the selling prices of used cars. The project involves several steps, including data exploration, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about various cars, including their features and selling prices. The dataset is initially explored to understand its structure and content.

#### Features
The dataset includes several features that can potentially impact the selling price of a car:

Age: The age of the car in years.
Engine: Engine specifications and capacity.
Fuel Type: The type of fuel used by the car.
Kilometers Driven: The total distance the car has been driven.
Transmission: The type of transmission (manual/automatic).
...

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to gain insights into the dataset. Visualizations and summary statistics are used to understand the distributions of features, identify correlations, and detect outliers.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. This step ensures the data is suitable for training machine learning models.

## Modeling
Various machine learning algorithms are employed to predict car prices. The chosen algorithms include Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

## Evaluation
The models are evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) to measure their predictive performance. Cross-validation is used to assess the models' generalization ability.

## Feature Importance
The importance of features in predicting car prices is analyzed. Techniques such as permutation importance and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values are used to interpret the models' decisions.

## Conclusion
The project concludes with insights into which features play a significant role in predicting car prices. The best-performing machine learning model is identified, and recommendations for further improvements are discussed.
